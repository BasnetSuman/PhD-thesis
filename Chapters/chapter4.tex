\chapter{Adding Support to a New School}
\label{cha:porting_novathesis}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Try all the already supported schools and check which one is closer to your needs;
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Edit \verb!Config/1_novathesis.tex! and near line 28 uncomment the line with key \verb!\ntsetup{school=<SOMETHING>}!;
    \item For each school supported (see the comment), replace \verb!<SOMETHING>! with the school name, e.g., make it \verb!\ntsetup{school=ulisboa/fmv}!
    \item Recompile and check the document.  Particularly, check the cover layout, the front-page (second cover) layout, the front-matter contents, the bibliography style;
    \item Repeat for the next school, until you find one close enough.
  \end{enumerate}
