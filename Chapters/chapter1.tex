\section{If You Use this Template…} 
\label{sub:if_you_use_this_template}

This first Chapter introduces the \gls{novathesis} template and how it is organized. In Chapter~\ref{cha:users_manual} you can find some specific instructions on how to use the \gls{novathesis} template.  Chapter~\ref{cha:a_short_latex_tutorial_with_examples} shows some examples and give some hints on how to write your text. Please read these next Chapters carefully.

\subsection{Your Time is Valuable}
\label{sub:time_is_money}

Did you learn how to drive by sitting by the wheel and throwing your car into the road?  Or did you take your time \emph{learning the rules} and \emph{practicing} first?  Thus, it is not wise to throw yourself at the task of writing a thesis/dissertation without seriously considering the following statement!

% subsection subsection_name (end)
\begin{quote}
  \rule{\linewidth}{2pt}
If you are going to spend zillions of hours writing your thesis/dissertation using this \gls{novathesis} template, be wise and spend a couple of hours learning how to use it properly by reading this manual.  And then be even wiser and spend a few more hours \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/wiki#learning-latex}{learning some \LaTeX}.  I am sure that the time you are investing now will pay itself countless times before you submit your thesis/dissertation.

\subsection{Appeal}
\label{sub:appeal}

The \gls{novathesis} tempalte was born in~1996, and what you see now accumulates to many many hundreds (thousands?!) of working hours, unpaid and stollen from family and friends.  This work is available to the community under the \href{LaTeX project public license}{\LaTeX\ Project Public License v1.3c}, which means you are entitled to use it for free.  However, if you decide to use this template to write your thesis/dissertation, \textbf{be fair to the developers} and:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cite the \gls{novathesis} manual~\cite{novathesis-manual} in a place of your choice (e.g., in the \emph{Acknowledgments}) of your thesis/disseration with “\verb!\cite{novathesis-manual}!” .  If you cite it this way, the correct entry will be added automatically to your bibliography (no need to worry with the necessary BibTeX entry, as it will be added automatically);
  \item Go to the
\href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{project web page in GitGub} and give the project a star (marked with a red ellipse at the top-right in Figure~\ref{fig:github}); and
  \item Make a donation by visiting the \gls{novathesis} project page and clicking in the button marked with a green ellipse at the top-center in Figure~\ref{fig:github}).  Alternatively, just click \href{https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=8WA8FRVMB78W8}{\fcolorbox{DarkGreen}{gray!15}{\textbf{~HERE~}}} and your browser will be directed to the right page.
\end{enumerate}

The \gls{novathesis} template was born at the \gls{DI} of  \gls{FCT} of \gls{NOVA}, Portugal.  But the user base grew… initially to other Departments of FCT-NOVA, then to other Schools of NOVA, and later to other Schools of other Universities.  Currently more than 25 Schools are natively supported by the \gls{novathesis} teamplte.

\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:getting_started}

The template provides an \emph{easy to use} setting for you to write your thesis/dissertation in \LaTeX:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Select your school;
  \item Fill your thesis metadata (title, research field, etc) in the file “\texttt{template.tex}”;
  \item Create your thesis/dissertation contents using the files in folder “\texttt{Chapters}”; and
  \item Process using you favorite \LaTeX\ processor (pdf\LaTeX, \XeLaTeX\ or \LuaLaTeX).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Using Overleaf}
\label{sub:using_overleaf}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\linewidth}
\vspace*{-10ex}\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{overleaf}%
\caption{NOVAthesis template in Overleaf.}
\end{wrapfigure}

If you do not have an account in \href{https://www.overleaf.com?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{Overleaf}, you must \href{https://www.overleaf.com?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{create one first}.

Once you have an account, please access the \gls{novathesis} template in \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/new-university-of-lisbon-universidade-nova-de-lisboa-slash-unl-thesis-template/fwbztcrptjmg}{Overleaf} and select the green button \emph{Open as Template}. 

\bgroup
  \itshape
  Please notice that the version currently available in Overleaf (v6.5.3) is slightly outdated (current version is v\novathesisversion). A new version will be submitted to Overleaf soon.  Until then, please:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Download the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/archive/master.zip}{latest version} from the GitHub repository as a Zip file.
    \item Login to your favorite LaTeX cloud service. I recommend \href{https://www.overleaf.com/?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{Overleaf} but there are alternatives (these instructions apply to Overleaf and you'll have to adapt for other providers).
    \item In the menu select: \texttt{New project} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Upload project}.
    \item Upload the zip with all the “novathesis” files.
    \item Select “template.tex” as the main file.
    \item Let Overleaf compile the document.
  \end{enumerate}
\egroup

\subsection{Using a Local \LaTeX\ Installation}
\label{sub:using_local_latex}

\newcommand{\MikTeX}{Mik\TeX}
\newcommand{\TeXLive}{\TeX Live}

First of all, start by installing \LaTeX\ in your computer.  There are two main distributions, \href{https://miktex.org}{\MikTeX}\ and \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\TeXLive}, and both of them are available for the~3 most popular Operating Systems: Linux, macOS and Windows.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{github}%
\caption{The NOVAthesis Project page in GitHub.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Be aware that a full installation of \MikTeX\ or \TeXLive\ will take near~5\,GB of hard disk space.  So, think twice before installing the full distribution.  See the \gls{novathesis} Wiki for the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/wiki/installing-latex#minimal-installation-in-any-of-the-systems-above}{list of packages required to compile the template}.

Once you have \LaTeX\ up and running, remember to install a good \LaTeX\ text editor.  I recommend you to take a look at  \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides}{this post} in the \url{tex.stackexchange.com} site.  If you want a quick and dirty recommendation, try \href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{TeXStudio}.

Now, you must access the \gls{novathesis} repository in \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{GitHub}, select the green button \emph{Code} and then \emph{download} (or \emph{clone}) the template.  You will always get the latest version of the template (currently v\novathesisversion\ from \novathesisdate).


\section{Getting Help}
\label{sec:getting_help}
Let's start with some simple suggestions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item No! You don't have to use this template to write your thesis.  You don't even have to use \LaTeX.  However, writing a thesis is serious stuff, and which tool you shall use to write it is not a decision to make lighthearted.
  \item \LaTeX\ is hard enough by itself.  This template aims at making your life easier, but not easy. If you choose to use this template to write your thesis, you are very welcome.  However, don't expect me to provide you help with \LaTeX.  Look for help with your friends (you have some friends, don't you?), or search the web, or try even to read some book(s) on \LaTeX. In the end you will certainly find the experience rewarding.
  \item So, don't forget, when you come to the point of “\emph{How do I do this with \LaTeX?}” look for help!  Google is your best friend. You may also ask for help in the \gls{novathesis} \href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/novathesis}{NOVAtheis Facebook group} or the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/discussions}{GitHub Discussions page}.  If you can't find help there from previous posts/messages, then post your own question. Hopefully someone will answer you. There were huge changes from version 4.x.y to version \novathesisversion, so \textbf{always} state the version number you are using when asking for help.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}  
  \fcolorbox{red}{gray!15}{\parbox{\textwidth}{\begin{center}\large\textbf{Please do not attempt to contact me directly (email, Messenger, etc)…\\I WILL NOT REPLY!}\end{center}}}
\end{center}
 

\section{Reporting Problems}
\label{sec:reporting_problems}

If you just need some help, see above \Autoref{sec:getting_help}.

If you believe \emph{you found a bug} or if \emph{you need some improvement} in the template, please \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/issues}{fill an issue} in the \gls{novathesis} \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/issues}{project page in GitHub}.


\section{Donors}
\label{sec:donations}

The \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/wiki#donators}{list of \emph{Donnors}} is available in the \gls{novathesis} Project page.


\section{Disclaimer}
\label{sec:disclaimer}

Although the \gls{novathesis} template is endorsed by some Schools (e.g., \href{https://www.fct.unl.pt/estudante/informacao-academica/teses-e-dissertacoes}{linked from FCT-NOVA web site}), the \gls{novathesis} template \textbf{this not an official template} for any School.

The \gls{novathesis} template exists to make your life easier and we do our best to make it compliant to the supported ($+25$) Schools' regulations but, in the end of the line, you and only you are accountable for both the look and the contents of the document you submit as your thesis/dissertation.
